Paragon Storage Setup

once you have the mod loaded and working on your server theres a few settings to change
first is to setup the attach to for the codelocks 
go to your servers ServerProfile>CodeLock>CodeLockConfig.json
and set CanRaidTents "true"
now thats thats setup you need to add the different storages to the hacking .json
go to your servers ServerProfile>TabletHacking.json (this file may be all the way at the bottom of the folder)
then you change how long you want the raid time to be and how many batteries each safe takes
